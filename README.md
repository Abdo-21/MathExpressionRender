There are many ways to represent math formulas in text. In this answer, i’ll use a simple, natural text format to keep it easy to parse (called AsciiMath).

Here’s an example of how it looks:

You can use the `ExpressionView` composable to display a math expression. For example:

```
ExpressionView(expression = "a^2 + 3")
```
This means you can save your math formulas as text in the format shown above and use `ExpressionView` to render them when needed.

**Notes:**

- This is a basic example and may have some bugs or performance issues. You’ll need to fix those if they come up.

- To keep the code short for this answer, I didn’t handle all edge cases. You might need to adjust it for your own needs.


I hope this helps you get started!
